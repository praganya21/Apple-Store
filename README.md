**Statement of Problem**

The stakeholder is an aspiring app developer who needs data driven insights to decide what type of apps to build and so he is seeking answers to questions like
- what app categories are most popular

**Key Insights**

- **Paid apps have better ratings** - Paid apps generally achieves sightly higher ratings than the free counterparts. This could be due to a number of reasons. Users who pay for an app may have higher engagement and perceived more value leading to the better ratings.

- **Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better rating** - Apps that support a number of languages between 10 and 30 have the highest average rating and it’s not really about the quantity of the language that your app support but is more like focusing on the right languages for your app. 

- **Finance and book apps have low ratings** - Categories like finance and book apps have lower user ratings and this suggests that user needs are not being fully met. This represents a market opportunity because if you create a quality app in these categories that addresses user needs better than the current offering, there is potential for high user ratings and market penetration. 

- **Apps with a longer description have better ratings** - The length of the app description has a positive correlation with the user ratings. Users are likely to appreciate having a clear understanding of the app’s features and capabilities before they download and so a detailed well crated description can set clear expectation and eventually increase the satisfaction of users. 

- **A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5** - On an average all the apps have a rating of 3.5 and so in order to stand out from the crowd, we should aim for a rating that is higher than the average 3.5.

- **Games and entertainment have high competition** – This category has a very high volume of apps suggesting the market may be saturated and so entering these spaces might be challenging due to high competition however you also suggest a high user demand in these sectors.
